### Setup

Before starting VS Code the first time, create its `Application Support` directory:

```
mkdir ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code
```

Clone repo as `User`:

```
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code
git clone git@github.com:corvino/vscode-settings.git User
```

Then you can fire up VS Code.
